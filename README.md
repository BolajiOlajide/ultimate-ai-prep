This project was built using Javascript. The stacks / technology used included:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB

This is my submission for the tests.
The project contains two different APIs known as `Api One` & `Api Two`. They both share depencies and are architected using `Yarn Workspaces`,
[(You can read about it here)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/). I have headed helpful scripts to simplify running the project,
they are contained in the `scripts/` folder.

## Setup / Installation

* clone the repository

* Install dependencies with the command `yarn`

* Start the both APIs using the command

```sh
yarn start
```

* Run the unit tests for both API using the command

```sh
yarn test
```
